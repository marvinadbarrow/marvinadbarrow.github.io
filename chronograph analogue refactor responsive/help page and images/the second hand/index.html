        <img id="seconds-and-split" src="../images/The Second Hand.png" alt="chronograph second hand and split second hand snapshot"><p><span class="dial-heading">The Second Hand:</span> As you can see, the second hand is quite easy to read. You could even get a good assessment of the split second value by looking at the sub-markings between the seconds markings. But I've added a split second subdial as an additional option to make the reading even easier.  These two hands, taken together, give you a precise time to tenths of a second </p>
        </div>


<img id="tenth-second" id="seconds-detail" src="../images/The Second Hand details.png" alt="chrono second hand in detail"><p><span class="dial-heading">Second Hand Detail: </span>when the stopwatch is paused or in lap mode, check where the large second hand is. It will often be between two seconds.  As you can see, the time here is just a bit more than 6 seconds. It's not quite halfway between 6 and 7 seconds, maybe it's 6.2 seconds, or 6.3 seconds, at a guess.  But you don't have to guess because we have the split second value below</p>

    <div class="dial-container">
        <img id="split-detail" src="../images/Split Second Hand Detail.png" alt="split second dail in detail"><p><span class="dial-heading">Split-Second Detail: </span>Now all you  need to do is check the split-second subdial, which reads precisely the to tenths of a second; three tenths (0.3)in this case, and Just add that decimal value to the last seconds value; in this case 6 seconds. So the current time reading is 6.3 seconds. Of course, if you don't need such a precise measure, you could just approximate using the seconds hand by itself.</p>
