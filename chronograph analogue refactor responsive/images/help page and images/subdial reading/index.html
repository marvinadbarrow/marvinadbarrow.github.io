    <div class="dial-container">
        <img src="../images/seconds dial.png" alt="hours subdial"><p><span class="dial-heading">Regular Seconds Subdial: </span>This subdial gives no information about the stopwatch.  It measures the amount of seconds in normal time.  The normal time seconds have been relegated to a subdial is to allow the large second hand to measure the stopwatch seconds on the large dial face, which makes it much easier to read for quick reference. You can take your time reading regular seconds so their position in the small subdial is not a significant issue</p>
        </div>


<img id="tenth-second" src="../images/tenth second dial.png" alt="tenth seconds subdial"><p><span class="dial-heading">Split Second Subdial: </span> Each marker of this subdial marks tenths of a second, from zero tenths to ten tenths (one second). When the lap button is pressed the split second hand will stop at one of these ten tenths indicating the split second value - in tenths of a second - 3 tenths in this example. This split second value needs to be added to the current seconds value: if the seconds hand just passed 25 seconds, then the total time including split seconds is 25.3 seconds, that is, 25 seconds + 3 tenths of a second. </p>
</div>


    <div class="dial-container">
        <img src="../images/minutes dial.png" alt="minutes subdial"><p><span class="dial-heading">Minute Subdial: </span>One revolution of the minute subdial is equal to 30 minutes of stopwatch time. Thirty minutes is preferable to 60 minutes since, less indications are required, making it easier to read off the small subdial; - if you are uncertain about the number of minutes elapsed, just look at the HOUR subdial's hand and if it is less than halfway between HOUR markings you can read the dial as normal since the elapsed time is between 0 and 30 minutes; alternatively if the subdial HOUR hand is more than halfway between the HOUR markings, add 30 minutes to the time on the subdial, since the elapsed minutes are greater than 30 (somewhere between 30 and 60)  - the subdial shown could be either around 22 minutes, or 52  minutes, depending on where the HOUR hand is on the HOUR subdial</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dial-container">
            <img src="../images/hours dial.png" alt="hours subdial"><p><span class="dial-heading">Hour Subdial: </span>The hour subdial is easy to read since each mark represents one hour of elapsed time. Although the hand moves slowly between hour markings, there's no need to estimate the time; just cross check with the minutes hand and add its value to the last hour marker value the hour hand passed</p>
