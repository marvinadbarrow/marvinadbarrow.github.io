Rectangular numbers styling

have each set of four containers front inner and outer, back inner and outer, contained in just one separate element, seconds, seconds tens, etc. Each of the separate element will be a pair contained in the 'main' container, i.e. seconds-main, minutes-main, hours-main. 

each of these container the elements that will have the background image of the top or bottom numbers. 

style the main container with an aspect ratio of 3/2, and everything else within it will have a width of just under a half of the main container and a height of 100% of the main container - EACH MAIN CONTAINER HOLDS BOTH MEASURE AND TENS OF MEASURE - When they are resized, the cards within them will automatically be resized themselves. 

dependent cards - position relative -  container is shaped as same size of flaps 45.8% of main container width, and 100% height of main container
45.8/100 is the same ratio as the designed card (27.5/60)

Then nested elements (position-absolute); rotation container, which holds the div that will display the background image, and dependent faces which is the div displaying the background, will have width and lengths of 100% to completely fill the dependent cards container which they are within.

This main container is equivalent to the tens and units container for each time measure
