DEPLOYING THE APP - 

Delete node_modules folder before deployment. 
If you're working from another location then you can just run 'npm nodemon' as long as nodemon is in your 'devDependencies' list. 

Otherwise you would have to use the command nmp install -D modemon


You'll need to reinstall node into the main folder of the application when you want to start using node with the application... so I had to use the command: 'npm init'
This runs and walks you through some set up questions at the end of which a package.json file will be created. It contains info about the app, author, dependencies etc. 

then you can run other dependencies such as 'npm install uuid' (third party stuff) 

You'll then be able to import all of the modules into script.js
