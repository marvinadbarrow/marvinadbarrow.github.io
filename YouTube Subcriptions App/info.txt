You have created a new client application that uses libraries for user authentication or authorization that are deprecated. New clients must use the new libraries instead. See the [Migration Guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/gis-migration) for more information.

 <script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" onload="initClient()" async defer></script>

        onreadystatechange="if (this.readyState === 'complete') this.onload()">
