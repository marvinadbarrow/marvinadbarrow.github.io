You have created a new client application that uses libraries for user authentication or authorization that are deprecated. New clients must use the new libraries instead. See the [Migration Guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/gis-migration) for more information.

 <script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" onload="initClient()" async defer></script>

 <script async defer src="https://apis.google.com/js/api.js"
        onload="this.onload=function(){};handleClientLoad()"
        onreadystatechange="if (this.readyState === 'complete') this.onload()">
</script>

// PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE THE APPLICATION - 

They will need to go into the yt_account.json file and alter it. 

API KEY
They need a google developer acount and to get an API key.  Then replace the API key in the JSON file with their own key.

CHANNEL ID

CLIENT INFO
Then user will need to replace the client_secret.json file that I'm using (they won't have access since they cannot log into my account) with their own which they can download once creating OAuth 2.0 credentials
Just place the downloaded file in main directory and rename it as client_secret.json


OAUTH 2.0 credentials. 
In order to get the credentials they'll need to create credentials in the google developer console and once that is done they  will have to download the OAUTH client with the download button.  It will have all the relevant information that will be imported by the main javascript file.
