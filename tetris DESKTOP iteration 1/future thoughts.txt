nearly finished tetris
in kitchen, thinking about a future time at a meetup describing an earlier future time of how I solved problems, but then realizing that I was imagining a future time, before the meetup time and before the project finish time, describing in Angelo's comment section of how I was doing that... and right then, while I'm thinking this and taking plates out of the kitchen cupboard, another thought comes, 'Oh... I should have accepted the bowl from Myrto... she was upset that I didnt...' 

crazy how thoughts just go anywhere -- 
just before the above I was thinking about how disappointed I was in myself for not developing talents and using them for work, then I thought about Lisa and the RiseSmart session coming up and how I would make excuses because I feel embarrased at no progress... then I went to imagining that I got a job and Corrine felt proud and I was telling her about my doubts of not FINALLY achieving something with my talents.... thoughts all over the place... this happened in a space of maybe 5 minutes.  

then thought about describing my success to Varinder...
Then saw college kids, a girl with black hair and a guy with long blonde hair and he looked like a girl.  I thought back to the 70's with long haired guys and wondered if there were a lot of gay guys on the down low...

Then I thought about moving on to freecodecamp and struggling with the examples... yes... ridiculous amount of thoughts... seemingly random, but related to whatever is going on... so, essentially random.... but apparently caused by whatever is going on and perhaps not by 'intention'.. 

Thought of talking to Marius and being happy because I got a job coding, but then thinking 'what if I was unhappy in the job?' and going into denial that a well paid job might be stressful and thinking that somehow I would cope with it.. and then imagining a coping strategy like getting enough rest etc...
