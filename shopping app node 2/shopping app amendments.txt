What I'm trying to do...

amend the basket item. 
options: 
change item total
delete item
cancel amend item

change:
use the HOLD MODAL format to change number (call it AMEND BASKET MODAL)
have current item total appear in number output
maybe change item total indicator dynamically to reflect new number
have a CONFIRM NEW TOTAL button -- this can take you back to the updated basket
have cancel button.............


delete item button will then take you to the delete-basket-item modal
That will have the delete/cancel buttons.  
Delete should take you back to updated basket
cancel should take you back to AMEND BASKET MODAL


cancel amend item should take you back to BASKET MODAL. 


for the delete or amend functions you'll need to adjust the associated arrays. and save the new arrays. 


added click event listener to reloaded basket items in loadShoppingList function, codeline 9, circa 497
