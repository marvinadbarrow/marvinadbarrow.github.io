The first section lasts 25 minutes long; that's when you should be studying; this is then followed by a 5 minute break where you rest from study so you can refresh your mind.  The timer repeats five times so you can study for two and and a half hours interrupted.  Each section's end time is marked with a short alarm to alert you of when a rest or study period is approaching.   This Method will help you study better, and leave you less tired after study .\n\nEnjoy\n\n#Pomodoro #StudyForFuture #TheTimer",

              "description": "Hi Guys TinyMaths here. Today we'll be learning how to Convert Improper Fractions to Mixed numbers. \nWe'll be converting these two examples -  10/9 -  5/2. These fractions are improper since, for both of them, the numerator is larger than the denominator; 10 is larger than 9, and 5 is larger than 2.  Normally, when taking tests and answering questions involving fractions, if the result you get is an improper fraction, you will be expected to convert it to a mixed number.  A mixed number is just a number that is made up of two elements, a whole number and a fraction.\n\nIn today's lesson we'll see that Improper Fractions are really just Mixed Numbers in disguise. Improper fractions and mixed numbers are just the same value written in two different ways. In order to do this effectively you will need to know how to do simple division and with our two examples, 10/9 and 5/2, we'll see exactly how division is used to convert the improper fractions to an equivalent mixed number. \n\nThis video is part of a series on mixed numbers which will give you a good overall understanding of mixed numbers so that you will be able to manage questions that involve these types of numbers. I've linked to them all below and there are onscreen video links at the end of this video.

              "description": "Hey Guys, TinyMaths here, back with another lesson. Today we are looking at how to convert recurring decimals to fractions. We’ll be converting these examples:\n\n0.6262626262...\n3.626262626262.....\n0.27626262626262...\n0.21586586586586....\n\n A recurring decimal is a number, where, after the decimal there is a pattern of numbers that repeat over and over again forever.  We'll consider two kinds. Firstly where the recurrence happens immediately after the decimal point, and then another situation, where immediately after the decimal point, there are some non-repeating numbers, and then the numbers after those repeat over and over again forever. \n\nThese methods share some similarities with my previous video where I showed you how to convert normal decimals to fractions; so it would be useful for you to review that video; I'll link it below. \n\nHopefully by the end of the lesson you will be able to convert recurring decimals to fractions, not only where the value is less than one, but also where there are mixed numbers so you have whole numbers before the decimal and recurring numbers after the decimal.  \n\nI don't simplify any of the fractions that I convert from recurring decimals here because they are quite hard to simplify, but if you wish to give them a try, you might want to watch my tutorial on simplifying fractions first, below: \n\nVideo: Convert Decimals To Fractions - https://youtu.be/sil74Qa6vzQ\n\nHere's my video “ How To Simplify Fractions Using Prime Factorization”,  if you need a refresher lesson:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLFQ2LXeMk\n\n\nIf you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask in the comment section: \n\nEnjoy.\n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\nContents: \n\n0:00 - What's in this video?\n0:33 - Two Types of Recurring Decimals\n1:01 - Example 1 (0.626262..)\n4:27 - Supplementary Example (3.626262...)\n5:15 - Example 2 (0.27626262...)\n8:50 - Be Careful When Multiplying \n9:59 - Example 3 (0.21586586586...)\n14:16 - To Simplify or NOT...\n15:24 - Useful 'Simplifying' Tutorial\n\nMusic: \n\nIntro and Outro - \nDeep Space - ambient lofi hip hop beat (FREE FOR PROFIT USE)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcm6gpuxlfY\n\nMusic Credit: \nProd Riddman\n\nFor more great music by Prod Riddman link to Channel below: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdSuKogXJOZld5Dzw_9285w",

              "description": "Hey guys; TinyMaths here, back with another video.  In today’s lesson you’ll be learning how to convert decimals into fractions. It’s a 5 step process which, once you’ve learned it, will make converting decimals to fractions quite straightforward. \n\nWe'll be using three examples: 0.62, 0.243 and 3.62\n\nThese are the 5 steps you'll need to follow. \n\n1. Give the decimal a label 'X'\n2. Turn the Decimal into a whole number by multiplying it by a power of 10. (use 10 to the power of how many decimal places your number is; for example, if your number is 0.245, since there are 3 decimals, you would multiply this number by 10 to the power of 3 which is 1000.  That will give you the number 245, and then you write the equation 0.245 x 1000 = 245)\n\n3. Replace the decimal with its label 'X' in the equation you created\n4. Find the value of 'X' by dividing both sides of the equation to get X on its own (this should give you that X on the left hand side is equal to a fraction on the right hand side). \n5. Replace 'X' with the original decimal and you should have your result; the decimal on the left hand side of the equals sign and a fraction on the right side of the equals sign. The conversion is complete. \n\nYou will also need to know how to simplify fractions since your final fraction will likely have large numbers for numerator and denominator. \n\nHere's my video “ How To Simplify Fractions Using Prime Factorization”,  if you need a refresher lesson:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLFQ2LXeMk\n\n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\nContents: \nWhat's In This lesson - \n0:25 Example 1 - Converting 0.62\n2:49 Which power of 10?\n3:25 Example 2 - Converting 0.243\n4:47 Example 3 - Converting 3.62\n6:32 What's in the next lesson?\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic: \n\nIntro: (no copyright) Jazz Lofi hip hop | vlog music | background music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjFrKRW-7Qw\n\nMusic by MetzMusic Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgHu0Lr6cwaPg_c9A6545qw\n\nOutro: \nChill Lofi Hip Hop Beat FREE (No Copyright) Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX41WxkS2d0\n\nMusic by Chill Out Records - No Copyright Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iczXFcRRg5nN_IVQOXIaA",

              "description": "Today we are going to be learning how to convert mixed numbers into fractions.  By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to use four simple steps to convert ANY mixed number you come across. Basically a mixed number is a number that is made up of two different parts; one part of the mixed number is a whole number and the other part is a fraction; actually a proper fraction where the denominator is a bigger number than the numerator\n\nMixed numbers can be re-written as fractions.  An important thing to remember is that once you’ve re-written a mixed number, the resulting fraction should be an improper fraction\n\nThere are four simple steps to converting Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions; here they are below: \n\nSTEPS: \n1)Take a copy of the numerator of the fraction to the RHS \n2) Take a copy of the denominator of the fraction to the RHS\n3) Multiply the Whole Number by the original denominator.\n4) Add the result you got in step 3 to the RHS numerator.\n\nThese steps must result in improper fractions. \n\nWe’ll convert two examples; I’ll give the mixed numbers and their equivalents below and during the lesson you will see exactly how I do the conversions of the mixed numbers and arrive at the fractions: \n\nExample 1 - 4 ½ = 9/2\nExample 2 -  5 ⅔ = 17/3\n\nAt the end of the lesson I’ll leave some examples for you to try and you can write the answers in the comment section if you want to.  \n\nI’ve also done a different lesson on Mixed Numbers where I teach how to add two Mixed Numbers - here is the link: \n\nHow To Add Mixed Numbers With Different Denominators - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsYDsPsrsQ\n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nMusic: \n\nIntro: \n(no copyright music) lofi type beat “biscuit”   free vlog music   prod by lukrembo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtZ2m2Zm3vY\n\nFrom LuKremBo Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUuUhBChMXm-irdwoFT-vg\n\nOutro: \nChill Lofi Hip Hop Beat FREE (No Copyright) Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX41WxkS2d0\n\nFrom Chillout Records - No Copyright Music Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iczXFcRRg5nN_IVQOXIaA\n\nContents: \n0:00 - What’s In This lesson and Definitions\n1:16 - How The Method Works\n1:51 - Example 1 - Converting 4 ½ to a Fraction\n2:58 - Example 2 - Converting 5 ⅔ to a Fraction\n4:02 - Further Examples To Try and Summary of Method\n4:46 - Another Mixed Numbers Video",

              "description": "Hey All, TinyMaths here, back with another video. In today’s lesson we’ll be looking at how to multiply fractions by whole numbers..  There’s a few things you’ll need to know in order for you to understand this lesson.  \n\nWhat you need to know. \nKnow how to find common factors with prime factorization or other methods\nHow to simplify fractions\nHow to Convert Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers\n\nIf you need to refresh your memory on how to do these I’ve linked my previous videos covering these subjects here; \n\nHow To Find The HCF of Two Numbers  Using Prime Factorization\nhttps://youtu.be/vHVVs-COFKA\n\n\nHow To Simplify Fractions Using Prime Factorization - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLFQ2LXeMk\n\nHow To Add Mixed Numbers With Different Denominators - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsYDsPsrsQ\n\n\nIn this lesson we’ll be examining two methods of adding multiplying fractions with whole numbers. The first method is listed below: \n\nMultiply the whole number by the numerator (becomes the new numerator)\nDo nothing to the denominator; just take it to the other side \nFor the new fraction; If the fraction is improper then convert to a mixed number/ if it is a proper fraction, simplify where possible. \n\nWell use this method to solve the problem 6*4/9. \nThen we’ll discuss the following problem; 54*24/92. It will become clear that this is more difficult. And then we will show the following method which makes this kind of problem easier. Here are the steps - \n\nIf the fraction can be simplified, do so. \nThen, if the whole number and denominator of the fraction share any factors, Using cancellation, divide both by the highest one, the HCF.  \nThen, use the simple method described before \n\nThis will make the more difficult problem much easier, Finally, we will also use this second method to solve the initial problem of 6*4/9.  Hopefully you will find both of these methods useful, but I recommend using the second method if you have to multiply large numbers or if your fraction contains large numbers; you’ll find it much easier to break it down to the second method.  The next video will be on how to divide fractions, which should be easy to follow if you thoroughly study this lesson.

By the end of Today's lesson, you will understand: \n- What equivalent Fractions Are\n- How To Create Them, and\n- Where They Are Used\n\nWe'll look at several fractions that appear different but that are all equivalent to 1/2. We'll show this using simple shapes and then we'll show how each fraction compares to 1/2 and we'll also discuss how the ratio between a fraction's numerator and denominator tell us if it is equivalent to other fractions. \n\nWe will also consider two fractions 19/25 and 1120/1750 and show that, although they appear to be completely different, they are actually equivalent to each other.  By the end of the lesson you will understand why this is clearly the case. \n\nFinally we will look at two situations where knowledge of Equivalent Fractions is very useful.  Firstly where we have to add dissimilar fractions, and then when we have to reduce a fraction to its simplest form. \n\nI'll also recommend other videos where you can see directly how equivalent fractions can be used. \n\nThe two recommended videos are detailed below and you should watch them 'after' this video lesson. \n\n Recommended Videos: \nHow To Add Fractions with Different Denominators Using Lowest Common Multiples -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAmiqZLrhnI&t=481s\n\nHow To Simplify Fractions Using Prime Factorization - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLFQ2LXeMk\n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nMusic: \n\nIntro and Outro - \ndeep space - ambient lofi hip hop beat (FREE FOR PROFIT USE)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcm6gpuxlfY\n\nMusic Credit: \nProd Riddman\n\n\nFor more great music by Prod Riddman link to Channel below: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdSuKogXJOZld5Dzw_9285w\n\n\nContents:\n0:00 - Lesson objectives\n0:55 - Equivalent Fraction Basics - Visual Aid\n1:54 - How Equivalent Fractions Are Made \n2:46 - Theory Behind Equivalent Fractions\n4:06 - Example (16/25 = 1120/1750)\n6:35 - Where Equivalent Fractions Are Used (A) Dissimilar Fractions. \n8:05 - Where Equivalent Fractions Are Used (B) Simplifying Fractions\n8:58 - Further Help (What To Watch Next)",

              "description": "Description box:\n\nWhat you need to know to understand this lesson: \n1--- How to do Prime Factorization\n2--- How to find HCF of 2 numbers \nCheck Out My Previoius Videos that go into more detail on these subjects: \n\nWhat Is Prime Factorization? https://youtu.be/1MPnDudbMow\n\nHow To Find HCF of Two Numbers (using Prime Factorization) https://youtu.be/vHVVs-COFKA\n\nHi Guys, back with another video. In this lesson you’ll learn how to use PRIME FACTORIZATION to find the Highest Common Factor (or Greatest Common Divisor) of the Numerator and Denominator of a fraction so you can simplify the fraction (also called reducing the fraction).  \nKnowing the HCF of two numbers is very useful when you are asked to simplify fractions. If you can find the HCF of the numerator and denominator of a fraction, you can divide both by the HCF and that will give you the fraction reduced to its simplest form. \n\nThe most common way of doing this is by listing the common factors of the numerator and denominator of the fraction and then looking for the Highest Common Factor (HCF), that is, the largest of the common factors. Then one can divide the top and bottom of the fraction using the HCF to simplify the fraction. \n\nBut this becomes difficult if your fraction Numerator and denominator are large numbers. That’s where it is better to simplify the fractions using prime factorization.  \n\nToday You’ll learn how to simplify Fractions using Prime Factorization to find the HCF.  We’ll simplify the fraction 25/48 the common way, and then we will simplify the same fraction using Prime Factorization.  We will also simplify a harder fraction, 1120/1750, using prime factorization. You will see that the prime factorization method is much faster and less confusing for these harder fractions, and, overall, it is a better method for simplifying even simpler fractions.  \n\nToday’s lesson is the final part of the series dealing with Prime Numbers and the benefits of knowing how to  use them.

              "description": "In this lesson we’re going to show you how to find the highest common factor of two numbers, by using a method called Prime Factorization.  If you don’t know what prime factorization is, then I’ve linked to my video ‘What is Prime Factorization?’ here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MPnDudbMow\n\n\n and I’ll also link to it at the end of this video.  It’ll help you better understand what’s going on in the lesson.\n\nWe’ll look at two sets of numbers, first we’ll find the HCF of 60 and 30, and then the HCF of 1750 and 1120. I’ll cover the basics of common factors first for those who need a reminder of how to find them. You’ll see how to use Prime Factorization to find the HCF of any two numbers, Especially large numbers. \n\n There will be one more video in this series where I show you how to use the HCF to simplify fractions, using prime factorization to find the HCF’s.\n\nThis lesson is part of a series covering Prime Numbers and their uses.\nCheck out the OTHER videos in this Series:\n\nHow To Find Prime Numbers: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMwsI0giJ4\n\nFinding Prime Numbers From 1 to 100:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYy3oTE67tQ\n\nWhat Is Prime Factorization:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MPnDudbMow\n\n\n\nRelated Videos:\nHow To Find The LCM of Two or Three Numbers:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v79EPbER--g\n\n\n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nMusic: \n\nIntro: \n(no copyright music) lofi type beat “biscuit” | free vlog music | prod. by lukrembo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtZ2m2Zm3vY\n\n\nFrom ‘Lukrembo’ channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUuUhBChMXm-irdwoFT-vg\n\n\n\nOutro: \n((FREE)) Lofi/Chill hop Type Beat - \"Two Lips\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX41WxkS2d0&list=PL06diOotXAJJHjvUm7FNNG5a7XUA2_C27&index=11\n\nFrom ‘Zeeky Beats’ Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg4idhC3WZyIMv5m7GzURg\n\n\n\n\n\nContents: \n\n0:00 Intro - What You’ll Learn in This lesson\n1:09 - Common Factors Review\n2:55 - What About Large Numbers?\n3:31 - HCF (30,60)\n6:17 - HCF (1750,1120)\n9:46 - What to Watch Next\n10:04 - Other Useful Videos",

              "description": "Today is a short lesson where I show you how to find prime numbers from 1 to 100 using the process called The Sieve of Eratosthenes. \nIn this process, you will be gradually cancelling numbers off the 1 to 100 list by crossing out the multiples of the primes 2, 3, 5 and 7 that are not greater than 100. \n\nBy the time the process is over, the only numbers left are the prime numbers smaller than 100. \n\nThe process is very easy and only requires you to know your times tables for the first four primes, 2, 3, 5, and 7 and only multiples no greater than the number 100.\n\nThis lesson does not  cover the basics of how to find prime numbers so if you need to learn about prime numbers in detail or need a refresher click the link below which is a video I made showing you how to find Prime Numbers. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMwsI0giJ4\n\nAfter today’s lesson you should find it very easy to find prime numbers between 1 and 100. You can even use it to eliminate larger numbers as not prime with a bit of practice. \n\nThis is the second video in a series where I teach you about prime numbers and their uses.  Other videos in the series deal with Finding The Lowest Common Multiple of 2 or 3 Numbers (Already made - video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v79EPbER--g  ) , Finding the Highest Common Factor of 2 numbers, how to do Prime Factorization of any number and  how to use prime factors to simplify fractions.

We’ll first discuss where you will find Prime Numbers (Clue: in the Natural numbers), and then we’ll review the properties of Natural numbers and show how those properties help us in finding prime numbers.  I’ll then show you how you can go about looking at individual numbers and working out if they are prime or not.  We’ll also look at some methods for finding the prime numbers that are less than 100, and finally we’ll give a few quick examples of how to use the concepts learned in the lesson.  By the end of the lesson Prime numbers will have been explained and you should then be able to find prime numbers without much difficulty. \n\n\nToday’s video is the first in a series, Actually I’ve made one of the videos already before, and I’ll link to it here, but in the rest of the series I will be showing you how to use prime numbers to do prime factorization, that is how to write numbers as a  product of prime factors, how to find the highest common factor of 2 numbers, how to find the Lowest common multiple of 2 or 3 numbers, and finally how to use prime numbers and prime factorization when simplifying fractions.

              "description": "Corresponding and alternate angles of parallel lines are the angles that result when you have two parallel lines and you have one straight line that crosses through both of those lines at an angle. \n\nWe'll explain how you identify alternate and corresponding angles, and then I have two example questions for you to try out; you can use what you've learned today to see if you can find the corresponding or alternate angles and use that information to answer the two questions. \n\nCorresponding anges and Alternate angles come in pairs.  On their own they do not have an identity, but are named corresponding or alternate in relationship to another angle. So a corresponding angle is only such because of how it compares to a reference angle; the same is true of alternate angle. So Corresponding angles and Alternate angles come in pairs, corresponding pairs and alternate pairs and you will learn how to identify these pairs in today's less. \n\nAt the end of the lesson I link to another video where I show how the use of this concept helps us prove that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

              "description": "In this lesson we will give proof that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. This proof is necessary because from the knowledge that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can then use triangles and their angle measurements to calculate all other types of polygons, whether they be squares, quadrilaterals, Pentagons etc. \n\nWhat you need to know to understand this proof: \n\nTo  understand this proof there are two things you need to know. \n\n1)t ‘the sum of all angles on a straight line is 180 degrees’, and\n2) You also need to know how to find alternate angles\n\nIf you are unsure about how to find alternate angles, here is a link to my video on the subject where I discuss the basics of both Corresponding angles, AND alternate angles: \nhttps://youtu.be/LX0By_fUI_c\n\nFeel free to check that video out after you have watched today’s lesson on how we prove that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. \n\nOnce we have shown the proof we will then look at a few examples of how you can use triangles to determine the sum of all angles in other polygons such as Pentagons and Hexagons and even oddly shaped polygons. \n\nFor a full understanding of why the triangle angles of 180 degrees is so important, I also recommend watching my video on why the formula (n-2)180° works for finding the sum of angles in ANY polygon and how the sum of angles in a triangle is related to this formula.

              "title": "How To Find The Angles of an ISOSCELES Triangle",
              "description": "Here’s a quick lesson on how to find the angles of an isosceles triangle, if you are given the size of just one the angles. Finding Angles in an isosceles triangle is not too difficult, you just need to remember that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, and then remember that in an isosceles triangle, there are two identical angles and one angle that differs in value from the identical other two. \n\nIf the given angle is the unique angle (the angle that sits between the sides of equal length, or in the position in between the two strokes indicating an isosceles triangle), then to find the other angles in the isosceles triangle just subtract the value of the unique angle from 180 degrees and then divide the result by 2. The number you get will be the size of each of the identical angles. \n\nIf on the other hand the given angle is not between the sides of equal length, then it must be one of the two identical angles (so the other angle that sits between two sides of different lengths must also have the same value of the given angle. Therefore, to find the remaining angle of the isosceles triangle you need to double the value of the given angle and then subtract the result from 180 degrees. That will give you the value of the ‘unique’ angle that sits between the two edges of equal length. \n\nIf you find these examples easy, I have added a linked  video at the end of this lesson with a harder example where none of the internal angles in the isosceles triangle are given, and the only angle available is an outside angle. Check that out so you can really put your knowledge of triangles to use.  \n\n\n\nContents: \n0:00 - Introduction\n0:09 Example 1\n2:57 Example 2\n4:50 Rules for calculating missing angles\n6:00 Outro and Next Video - harder example\n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nMusic: (Chill Out Records Channel) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iczXFcRRg5nN_IVQOXIaA/videos\n\n\nIntro and Outro Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ojb8t3T2Ng&list=PL06diOotXAJJHjvUm7FNNG5a7XUA2_C27&index=3",

              "description": "In this video I’ll be showing you how to find the lowest common multiple of Two AND 3 numbers. The ability to find the LCM of two or more numbers is useful for when you need to add or subtract fractions with different denominators. \n\nToday we’re going to be looking at two methods for finding the Lowest Common Multiple of 2 or 3 numbers.  \n\nThe steps to the first Method are: \n\n1) List List the first few multiples of each number \n2) Look for multiples that appear on both lists. (364)\n\nI find it better to list the multiples of the largest number first, and then work down to smaller numbers, and once I have a few numbers in both all lists of multiples, I look for the lowest number which appears on all three lists.  This is the lowest common multiple of all 3 numbers. \n\nThis first method is straightforward, but might get difficult if you have large numbers and you aren’t an expert at your times tables since you’ll need to write very large multiples.  There’s an alternative method you can use for finding the lowest common multiple if your numbers are awkward and I list the steps to the second method below. \n\n\n1) Write each number as a product of prime factors, and \n2) Multiply the prime factors together, to find the LCM\n\nIn order to use this method you must know how to write numbers as a product of PRIME FACTORS. You must then use the method indicated in the videos for working out step 2, which numbers you multiply together; what to leave in the multiplication and what to leave out. \n\nAfter watching this video you should be able to find the lowest common multiple of not just 2 or 3 but any amount of numbers as long as you take your time; and of course, this will also help you in the process of adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, which requires the knowledge of how to find the lowest common multiple of different denominators. \n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nVideo Contents\n\n0:00 - Example 1) LCM of 4 and 5\n0:40 - List Multiples of Both Numbers\n1:24 - Pick Lowest Common Multiples of 4 and 5\n\n2:22 - Example 2) LCM of 2, 4, and 5\n2:30 - List Multiples of all 3 Numbers\n2:47 - Picking LCM of 2, 4 and 5\n\n3:45 - Example 3 ) LCM of 24, 15 and 9\n3:58 - List Multiples of 24, 15 and 9\n4:09 - Looking for common multiples of  24, 15 and 9\n\n5:42 - Example 3 With Alternative Method\n6:26 - Rewrite Numbers as Product of PRIME FACTORS\n6:46 - Creating a PRIME FACTOR Table\n7:59 - Calculate LCM by Multiplying Factors Together\n\n9:03 - Which Method is Better? \n\nMUSIC: \n\nMusic used in this video is the product of Royalty Free Music, from the Chill Out Records Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iczXFcRRg5nN_IVQOXIaA/videos\n\n\nIntro and Outro Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ojb8t3T2Ng&list=PL06diOotXAJJHjvUm7FNNG5a7XUA2_C27&index=3",

Previously we learned how to add two fractions with different denominators using a simple cross multiplication method, and then a more challenging method using the lowest common Denominator of two denominators. In this video we extend that to adding 3 fractions with different denominators using the Lowest Common Multiple method. I've included two examples that we will work on. \n\nThe steps for adding 3 fractions with different denominators are below: \n1) Find the Lowest Common Denominator of the three Fractions\n2) Convert The 3 different denominators to the Lowest Common Denominator\n3) Convert the Numerators so the values of your fractions don't change when you change the denominators to the LCD\n4) Replace your original 3 fractions with different denominators to the equivalent fractions, all of which now have the common denominator.\n5) Convert the result to a mixed number if it is an improper fraction, and simplify if possible. \n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nWhat you should already know: \n1) How to Add Fractions with Different Denominators (two fractions)\n2) How to Convert Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers\n3) How to simplify or reduce fractions (particularly how to spot whether simplifying is needed or not)\n\nWe'll be doing two examples in this video\n\nExample 1:  \n1/2 + 2/5 + 3/4\n\nExample 2:\n1/15 + 3/10 + 2/5  \n\nVideo Contents: \n0:00 Introduction\n0:46 - List of Steps For adding Fractions\n1:02 - Example #1\n1:25 - Find LCD\n2:25 - Convert Denominators to LCD\n3:08 - Convert Original Numerators\n4:07 - Replace Original Fractions\n4:55 - Simplify & Convert Result\n\n6:17 Example #2\n6:23 - Find LCD\n7:08 - Convert Denominators to LCD\n7:34 - Convert Original Numerators\n8:21 - Replace Original Fractions\n8:56 - Simplify & Convert Result\n9:58 Other Helpful Videos",

              "description": "Adding Fractions with different denominators can seem confusing at first. You know how to add fractions with the same denominator, that’s easy, but these fractions are unlike and therefore have different denominators. How do you add these kinds of fractions?  You might think that you have to add the numerators like you do with similar fractions, but that’s going to get you the wrong answer. \n\nWe can solve additional problems with unlike fractions by using the lowest common denominator of your fractions. In today’s lesson I show you how to find the Lowest Common Denominator of two fractions with different denominators, and how to  use this denominator (normally abbreviated to the LCD) to create equivalent fractions of your original unlike fractions, which will be much easier to add, because the resulting equivalent fractions will all have the same denominator. \n\nYou will then be able to add the fractions to come up with an answer. This process will make adding fractions with different denominators a lot easier.

              "description": "In this video I will be showing you how to add Mixed Numbers with unlike fractions step by step. Mixed numbers are composed of whole numbers and fractions. They are like a sum with a whole number and a fraction added. For example 3 + 1/2, which we would call 'three and a half'. When we are adding mixed numbers with unlike fractions, the fractions on the end of the whole numbers are 'NOT' similar, they have differing denominators. So we must use our knowledge of how to add unlike fractions while using the method in the video. The steps required for adding mixed number with unlike fractions are as follows: \n1. Make two columbs \n2.  Separate mixed numbers into whole numbers and fractions\n3. Write the whole numbers in the left columb \n4.  Write the unlike fractions in the right columb \n5.   Add the numbers in the left Column \n6.  Add the numbers in the right column (simplify answer and convert to a mixed number if the result is an improper fraction) Note: Cross multiplication method will sometimes cause\n7.  add the results from left columb and right columb that's your answer. \n\nSubscribe to TinyMaths here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TinyMaths/videos?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWhat you should already know before trying to add mixed numbers with unlike denominators: \n1. How to add fractions with different denominators: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwbNL7iyUfQ\n2. How to simplify Fractions using the HCF (highest common factor) of both denominators (not my Channel; this is The Organic Chemistry Tutor channel):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcEwj5_v75g\n3. How to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Cquv2ZGRA&t=168s\n\nExample No 1\n\n51/2 + 31/3\n\n1. Create columns right and left.  (you can separate the columns with a gap in the middle and put plus signs between the totals at the bottom. In left column put 5 and 3, In the right column put  1/2   and 1/3 \n2. Then 5 + 3 = 8\n3. Then 1/2 +1/3. We need a note on how to add unlike Fractions (relate previous video). Now since our Fractions have different denominators we need to know how to add unlike fractions.  We can use the simple method for adding these two fractions. Simply Multiply the left denominator by the right denominator. This gives us 2x3 = 6; and now we cross multiply the numerators with the denominators, so left numerator x right denominator giving 1x3 and right numerator x left denominator giving 1x2 and we now add these together on top of our new denominator so we get (2+3)/6 = 5/6\n4. Resulting Fraction is 5/6 (no need to simplify – no common factors)\n5. Not an improper fraction so we can't convert into a mixed number\n6. Left Column + right column = 8 + 5/6 = 85/6\nTherefore our final answer to the problem is 51/2 + 31/3  = 85/6\n\nExample No 2\n53/4 + 67/10\n\nI said smash the like button, comment and share so the channel can grow and we can help more people (use the screen tap animation for this) \nGo through steps 1-6 using 53/4 + 37/10\n1. Create columns right and left.  (you can separate the columns with a gap in the middle and put plus signs between the totals at the bottom. In left column put 5 and 6, In the right column put  3/4  and 7/10 \n2. Then 5 + 6 = 11\n3. Then 3/4 + 7/10 We can use the simple method for adding these two fractions. Simply Multiply the left denominator by the right denominator. This gives us 4x10 = 40, which is our new denominator; and now we cross multiply the numerators with the denominators, so left numerator x right denominator giving 3x10=30, and right numerator x left denominator giving 7x4=28, and we now add these together on top of our new denominator so we get (30+28)/40 = 58/40. \n4. This fraction can simplify  using the highest common factor which is 2. So divide top and bottom by 2 and we get 29/20 which is an equivalent fraction to 58/40. \n5.  We haven't finished yet though, because we now have an improper Fraction.  Now we can view our fraction as a basic division dividing 29 by 20. So 20 goes into 29 once, leaving a remainder of 9 so the solution 29/20 can be rewritten as 1+9/20\n6. Now we have results in both columns all we have to do is add the values from the Whole number column to the values from the fractions column. So left Column + right Column = 11 + (1+ 9/20) = 129/20 \nTherefore  our final answer to the problem is 53/4 + 37/10 = 129/20 \nNow for those of you who have managed to stick around, thanks for doing so, and NOW, here is the bonus question, I'm taking a fraction from each of our two previous problems and creating a new problem, here it is 53/4 +31/3 \nCan you solve this problem using the steps we learned in today's video? See if you can do it! And don't forget; put your answer in the comment section.\n\nVideo Contents: \n0:00 Introduction \n0:51 Overview\n1:06 What you need to already know\n1:21 Example No 1 (5*1/2 + 3*1/3)\n4:14 Example No 2 ( 5*3/4 + 6*7/10)\n8:58 Bonus Question\n9:28 Time to say goodbye",

Finding Angles in a Polygon might seem confusing at first but once you learn that this formula can always be used, and why it is used, the Angles in a Polygon will be very easy to find and you will understand why a particular polygon has a particular sum of angles. \n\nVideo Chapters\n\n00:25 - intro: Finding TRIANGLES within polygons\n02:24 - Triangle\n04:52 - Quadrilateral\n06:30 - Pentagon\n09:11 - Heptagon ( 7 sided polygon)\n13:09 - Bonus shape (irregular pentagon, more difficult example)",
