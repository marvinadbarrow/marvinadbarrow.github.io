POSSIBLE FIX FOR MAXIMUM CALL STACK... 
Change the index value from '1' to zero on line 396


and then remove the numerator and denominator numbers from the zeroth positions of their respective factors arrays( lines 568 to 570),


 then, instead of using the zeroth position as the value to examine, just use the numerator/denominator/contents value; (line 397 and 399) where we've defined mainNum as numeratorFactorsArray[0], and mainDen as denominatorFactorsArray[0] - so these have to be changed to mainNum  = numeratorContents and mainDen = denominatorContents. 

probably best to make a backup copy of the original in case something goes wrong because this involves several changes.
